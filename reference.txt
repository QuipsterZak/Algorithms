==Binary Search==
For a list of n, binary search will take logâ‚‚n steps to run in the worst case.

Logarithms(flip of exponentials): 10^2 = 100 | logb10 100 = 2
                                  2^3 = 8 | logb2 8 = 3

Binary search only works when the list is sorted.

-Algorithms speed is measured by the growth of the number of operations, based on the size of the input.
-Run time is expressed in O notation
-O(log n) gets faster than O(n) the more elements are in the list.
-O(n/x) or O(n*x) is still O(n) 'x being a constant'
